                                            Analysis
In June we took the raw data to form temperature summary stastistics. In June we had a sample size of 1700 temperature checks. The average temperature was 75 degreees. There is a relatively small interval of temperatures that Hawaii has in the month of June. The range of temperature was only 21 degrees for the month. In December the 
temperatures were very similar to that of June. Since Hawaii is so close to the equator, there is not a wide range of annual temperatures. The mean temperature in December was 71 degrees only 4 beblow the June. This suggests the Surfing business will be profitable year round. There was a higher standard deviation for December though with a range of 27. This data indicates that December will have more days where the temperature isnt where it needs to be.
